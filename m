Hello there!
I was digging this when I had some free time and found that with
patches from Marek the only difference is that function
i2c_get_chip_for_busnum is not called for PMIC's main i2c address
which results in issues with i2c you have seen in logs before. I
assume this is not a tegra specific issue and not even related to
these regulator patches itself.

To verify my suspicions, Tom and Marek my you please dump u-boot log
with and without patches and with enabled debug logging from
i2c-uclass and i2c driver of your SoC.

Here are logs from my device (Tegra SoC)
