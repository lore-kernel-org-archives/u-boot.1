This RFC provides a proof of concept for using the full Linux CCF in
U-Boot and consequently porting full Linux clock drivers with extremely
minimal changes.

== Overview ==

This RFC is pretty long but can be separated into a few chunks. The
first patches relate to Linux API compatibility and just contain small
self contained changes, these can go upstream regardless of CCF.

The next group of changes prepare for importing CCF from Linux, the
standalone fixed clock drivers are moved to clk/basic, the existing
U-Boot CCF drivers are moved to clk/uccf, and struct clk_ops is renamed
to clk_ops_uboot.

Additionally, clk_set_rate() is changed so that it returns a signed
long, since it can return negative values. This is also done to align
with CCF but it's a standalone improvement nonetheless.

The next changes import CCF from Linux 6.19 and then adjust it to
compile and work with U-Boot. These commits are split up mostly to
try and reduce the size. Finally clk-uclass is adjusted for CCF, this
definitely will need some additional passes to be a bit cleaner.

With CCF done, sandbox clk-ccf driver gets a CCF_FULL port, the clk_ccf
tests are adjusted to pass.

Lastly, a PoC port of Qualcomms Linux clock drivers is done, this
only has sm8650 clocks but they serve the desired purpose. The changes
necessary to the Linux drivers are mostly to deal with U-Boots driver
model, the actual platform specific clock drivers require essentially
zero changes!

=== Feedback ===

I'd like to get feedback on the overall architecture and ideas, feel
free to point out any dead code or printf's I forgot about, but I'll for
sure do a more detailed cleanup before the next revision.

I would definitely like to input on how to deal with clk-uclass, since
it's now supporting 3 different clock frameworks, but I'm now sure how
best to separate the code out without duplicating code.

In terms of overall architecture, CCF is a departure from the uclass
model that U-Boot has stuck too for so long. If this is a success then
I think it could make a lot of sense to make similar changes for power
domains and resets. I think this change offers a lot of additional
flexibility which has been sorely missed.

== Motivation ==

There were quite a few motivating factors behind this effort which I
think provide useful context for this series:

1. Existing UCLASS_CLK support in U-Boot (even with U-Boots minimal CCF)
   doesn't provide a fully cohesive API nor implement the necessary
   functionality to support complex modern platforms without a lot of
   additional effort.

2. While trying to enable display support on Qualcomm, it became clear
   that U-Boots clock framework was a severe limiting factor,
   particularly for more complicated setups like "bonded" dual-DSI.

3. The current state of Qualcomm clock drivers in U-Boot is pretty poor,
   as the old very basic driver code is being expected to support more
   and more complicated usecases. Clock support is generally the most
   complicated part of bringing up any new Qualcomm platform, so being
   able to properly reuse Linux drivers with the familiar API greatly
   reduces the amount of friction when working on U-Boot support for
   complicated peripherals like the display.

Consequently, My aim with this effort was primarily to provide API
compatibility with Linux as much as possible, minimising the changes
that have to be made to clock drivers to port them from Linux, and
reducing the chance of introducing U-Boot specific bugs.

=== clk_ops/UCLASS_CLK ===

CCF_FULL drivers should NOT use UCLASS_CLK, since CCF uses a totally
independent clock API. If the clocks are provided by another device like
a phy, they can simply be registered with the clk core the same way they
are in Linux. Standalone clock drivers should use UCLASS_NOP.

Clocks must all be registered during driver probe, the CCF will ensure
that a given clock provider is probed (via a global ofnode -> device
lookup) before checking the of_providers, thus making sure the clocks
are registered so that the consumer can use them. There is currently no
special handling for cyclical dependencies.

=== struct clk ===

It's definitely debatable if it makes sense to have 3 different structs
for each clk (clk_hw, clk_core and clk). I do think clk_hw and clk_core
are justified, since clk_hw is more tied to the hardware description and
typically nested in a clk-specific descriptor while clk_core contains
the internal runtime state of the clk which should remain private to
CCF core.

It could make sense to merge clk and clk_core, but since struct clk is
public in U-Boot, where it's an opaque pointer in Linux this would be
a substantial effort. In Linux struct clk objects are allocated inside
CCF, but in U-Boot they're allocated by the driver, this would need to
be resolved before we investigate combining these structs.

=== Memory/perf overhead ===

The memory and size overhead of CCF is undoubtably bigger than uCCF,
although I suspect the difference is less than it might seem at
first glance. In particular: clk_core is only ~50 bytes larger than
struct udevice on ARM64, and an additional 120 bytes is saved for each
U_BOOT_DRIVER used by uCCF.

On the other hand, the CPU overhead is probably more significant,
but not an unreasonable cost to ensure correctness and propagate rate
changes across the clock tree.

Just comparing the binary size of sandbox64_defconfig with uCCF vs
CCF_FULL, CCF_FULL results in a 135k size increase in the binary. I
haven't done any more detailed analysis here (still haven't got buildman
to play nice...).

=== SPL ===

This RFC doesn't have any SPL specific support, I think this role is
better fulfilled by UCLASS_CLK.

=== U-Boot's old CCF port ===

The original CCF port done for IMX platforms is vastly different in API,
scope, and function to CCF_FULL, to differentiate I refer to it
as "uCCF".

I have kept support for this in and made it mutually exclusive with
CCF_FULL. uCCF drivers have been moved to drivers/clk/uccf, with the new
CCF port in drivers/clk/ccf.

Included near the end of this series is a port of Sandbox's clk-ccf
driver from uCCF over to CCF_FULL, this might be a useful reference for
other drivers (although it's probably better to just adapt the Linux
drivers).

=== Compat shim ===

Lastly, this series includes a compat shim which allows UCLASS_CLK
drivers to somewhat work with CCF, I would imagine this being useful
if some generic peripheral device provides a clock for example, but in
almost all cases I think it's better to implement a proper CCF clock
device. Unless there is a particular usecase for this I would probably
not include it in the next revision.

== TODO/Outstanding issues ==

* Clean up clk-uclass.c, does it make sense to somewhow split it in two?
* Assess test coverage, have basic sandbox tests, would like to mostly
  use integration tests (i.e. diff the clk summary) once more platforms
  are supported.
* pre-relocation support is currently missing, on Qualcomm at least I
  would prefer to completely skip FDT scanning pre-reloc, there is a
  patch in this series which does that. It is very non-trivial to try
  and handle clocks pre-reloc.
