Yeah, it will hopefully lead to better coordination between maintainers
in some places. There are SoCs where the kernel DTS people are the
U-Boot DTS people too. All in all, I should probably CC more people than
I usually do on these resync patches just to try and head off any
tricky changes like you've mentioned above.

The way we've always tried to operate is that changes should be pushed
to Linux and resynced down, or at least submitted simultaneously. If
there's some specific bugfixes that need to come in out of cycle I
_think_ subtree handles cherry picked commits in a reasonable fashion.
