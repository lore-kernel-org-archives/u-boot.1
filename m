OK, I want to stop here and rethink this. This is the path taken so
far, I believe:

1. We want to use devicetree files taken from Linux and
devicetree-rebasing provides these
2. We want to use 'git subtree' to avoid needing a script to do the
sync / create a commit
3. But this leaves us with a directory structure which doesn't match
U-Boot (no script to fix it up)
4. So we deal with that by skipping the build rules and using CONFIG
options to select what is built
5. So now we cannot build all the files for an SoC, just the ones that
are in the CONFIG options
6. Linux doesn't actually use devicetree-rebasing itself, so doesn't
have this problem

So this is heading in the wrong direction. Nor is it clear that this
would just be a temporary problem.

Possible options I see are:

a. Adjust U-Boot's dir structure to match Linux, first (but this might
be painful?)
b. Create a script to sync the files, so we can sync into a dir
structure that matches U-Boot
c. Add build rules to U-Boot's version of the devicetree-rebasing dir
(this seems to be supported)
d. Give up and just live with having boards (not SoCs) specify the
devicetree files they want to build

I would like to do this series properly, maintaining the SoC-specific
build rules, not removing what I see as an important feature. It
should not be that difficult to figure out and I am happy to help with
it.

Yes, I see that you did that.

This seems to be a fundamental point of disagreement. I would like all
boards for an SoC to have mostly the same defconfig and just use a
devicetree for differences, at least in U-Boot proper. That is what
devicetree is for. In fact, I would like to see a lot more defaults in
U-Boot, so that defconfig files are just a few lines like [2] and
there is no board-specific C code not gated by a compatible string.

Not relevant to the topic at hand, perhaps, but Qualcomm uses a
closed-source blob to jump to U-Boot and is certainly not an example
we should emulate. But yes, passing a DT to U-Boot proper can be
useful.

I certainly see many examples of that, but the majority of features
are covered. It was of course the same in Linux until someone put his
foot down.

If you mean OF_EMBED, then I don't think that is much used. It is just
for using a JTAG debugger and these days, it is barely useful for
that.

We do use fdtgrep to create a smaller FDT for SPL, though. In general,
it will be harder to create a general SPL for an SoC. But it is also
less beneficial, since SPL is small. Also, it is possible, as shown by
rockchip.

We mostly have them already, so we should not remove them.

We are setting policy here. The policy should bias towards the
generic, not to make that hard. There are over 900 arm64 devicetree
files in Linux but only a few dozen SoCs and only one build. We should
not have 900 arm64 U-Boots, only a few dozen and perhaps one day in
the dim, distant future, if the tradeoffs make sense, one.
