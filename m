Thank you very much for the information, it is a great read. Yes my
comment was wide of the mark and I am pleased to hear it.

BTW, I would very much like to see Linaro ensuring that new 96boards
have open source firmware before they are released. Before release
seems to be the only time that the vendor can devote time to it.

Regards,
Simon
