Yep, but I think maybe `u-boot-spl {};` might be cleaner than just
`blob`..

This is also how Amlogic works here. There's a single
u-boot-meson-with-spl.bin binary which contains the @AML bootROM header,
raw SPL binary, and the rest are fit images. The issue mainly lies in
the bootROM only reading up to 0xc000 bytes, and with the header taking
0x1000 bytes (there's padding, so that SPL gets loaded to 0xd9001000),
this means we only have 0xb000 for the entire SPL image.
