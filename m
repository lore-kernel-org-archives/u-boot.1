I'm happy to announce that U-Boot SPL can now boot on gxbb and gxl SoCs,
and I'll be sending some patches to upstream that work later on.

gxlimg now also supports G12A/G12B, but it does not support GXBB at the
time of writing.

Yes, my tree has documentation on how to make use of images generated by
amlimage.  I believe such documentation should be documented when there
actually is U-Boot SPL support as well.
