That would mean extra duplicate work -- the critical fixes have already 
been selected into linux-stable, that work is already done, I don't 
think it makes sense to re-do it again.

Furthermore, I do not like the new necessity to start porting those 
fixes from linux-stable and converting them to adjustments to 
*-u-boot.dtsi files, this is tedious and error prone, so it would have 
to be automated.

But I still think it is much better to simply take the fixes directly 
from linux-stable as-is instead.

That pull would break other peoples platforms. It would be no different 
than adding broken patch into the code base. What I think would be an 
option is that there is a pull (as in patch) and people should be able 
to test it before it is applied. If one platform is severely affected 
while other platforms are fine, the one platform should be able to use 
the current working version of DTs, while the other platforms should not 
be blocked by it. Is that what OF_UPSTREAM=n does ?

As far as I understand OF_UPSTREAM=n, it would require re-importing DTs 
into the codebase ?

I think upstreaming the bootph* properties would still take a while, but 
is not relevant to the aforementioned question.

Assume there is a sync, would the current in-tree -u-boot.dtsi files get 
updated to work correctly with the newly synced DTs ?
