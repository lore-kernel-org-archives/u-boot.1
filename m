Right.  Some time ago I suggested Simon to lobby the Linux kernel
folks to change the arm64 Linux kernel entry convention to state that
x1 can be non-zero in which case it points at a bloblist.  If that
happened I'd probably do the work to make m1n1 pass a bloblist.  And
it would probably make the folks who want to directly boot a Linux
kernel from TF-A (without going through U-Boot) happy as well.
