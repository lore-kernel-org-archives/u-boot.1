TBF, we do try to ask these questions as much as possible, usually (for
me at least) citing U-Boot or the BSDs as users. It largely seems to me
like we are all bark and no bite though, so a project like U-Boot having
a defined "schedule" as you suggest below would add more meaning to our
questioning.

I know this is the theory, but I also know that how well this is
implemented varies wildly per-platform. I generally don't pay all
that much attention to the various arm platforms, but I do pay
attention to what's going on for RISC-V and there appear to be no
active maintainers of individual platforms and the architecture
maintainers are not aware of the status of the equivalent patches
for Linux when they apply patches.

In recent memory, this has lead to the clock indices in the DT
differing between U-Boot and Linux for one such platform, which, IMO,
is an insidious difference that is hard to spot during review and highly
unlikely to crop up while comparing dts files, since the defines were named
identically. To be clear, I am not expecting the architecture code
maintainers to be aware of the minutiae of the various RISC-V platforms,
but rather suggesting they might have an easier time reviewing if both
projects' dts files and binding headers were tied together.

That said, automatically synced devicetrees will, as has been pointed out,
require the platform maintainers in Linux to be more aware of the affect of
what they accept on other users, but it will also require the equivalent
maintainers on the U-Boot side to engage too, so that the "upstream" dts
files do not change in a way that screws the usecase in U-Boot.

Also, if people send fixes to the U-Boot copies of these devicetrees,
would the plan be to request that these are sent to Linux and the fixes
pulled in via a resync after each -rc release of Linux (or similar, just
throwing some example schedule out there)?

Cheers,
Conor.
