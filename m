No. We intentionally abandon arch/*/dts because it's so full of
out of date files and never fully re-synced, only re-synced ad-hoc.

No. devicetree-rebasing skips the Makefiles because they're part of the
kernel. We couldn't re-use them ourselves because we don't have the same
CONFIG names the kernel does. And Sumit has not replicated the logic we
have under arch/*/dts/Makefile today because I've asked him not to, and
we'll figure out what subsets of that logic make sense to add back in as
a second step not a first step.

A previous iteration of this series built all of the dtb files for the
SoC that Sumit has migrated with this series, but then dropped it.

The problem is that the rest of us do not understand the use case you're
describing where a dtb file that would be useful in a build is not
already in the list to build. The only one of those use cases I
understand thus far is the exynos4 (iirc) case you mentioned previously
where yes, really, one defconfig + appending board.dtb is fine, or fine
enough. It's not that far off of the SPL_LOAD_FIT case, but there we
know what to build already.

And I guess trying to tie things up, that's my puzzle. SPL_LOAD_FIT is
how I see the use case you talk about being solved, if a full U-Boot is
generic enough for N boards, SPL_LOAD_FIT does the right thing (in this
non-bloblist DTB, non-reusing-OS-inntended DTB world). I really don't
knnow how many modern SoCs can take a literal concatenated DTB and even
in those cases I don't get why that's the win we want now? 1 build to N
binaries?

But even then, I don't object to adding those rules to the Makefiles. If
it works it works. I object to adding them when they don't work.

That's a nice goal to aim for. Sumit's work doesn't stop that being
aimed for, and by making it easy to keep our device trees modern, it
makes that easier, not harder.

Heck, it's something I've been working with the TI folks with for a few
years now, and this work will make things easier for them because the
dts files will get synced back, for all of the chips, sooner rather than
later, and we can push towards getting rid of most of the -u-boot.dtsi
work, and deal with the hard question of "where do r5 dts files go?".
But that will not get rid of board/siemens/iot2050/ because that's what
a custom hardware design needs and wants. Not "just pass the new DTB".
This is another of the valid use cases that we need to keep in mind and
design around, the explicit and intentional starting point of "don't
just run the EVM binary for custom hardware design production".

It's a very valid use case we need to continue to support. And to save
Mark from having to repeat himself, again, it's intentionally and not
changing, how the Apple M1/M2/etc platforms boot. I'm pretty sure the
fact that one can use U-Boot this way is part of how engineers get proof
of concept work done to show that if they had U-Boot available then they
could also support X/Y/Z easier. And maybe they'll be able to longer
term push internally to use bloblist to pass things along.

Heck, trying to not go too far off on a tangent, maybe the m1n1 loader
can implement both conventions, as both Linux Kernel[0] and Bloblist[1]
use x0 for device tree, but bloblist has x1 non-zero and Linux does not,
so both could be present here? Or is there some incompatibility I don't
see on quick skimming?
